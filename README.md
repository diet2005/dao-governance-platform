## üìä Understanding the Concepts

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

A DAO is an organization that is run through rules encoded as computer programs. Unlike traditional organizations, it operates without centralized control.

### Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They automatically execute actions when conditions are met.

### Tokens

Tokens play a key role in the governance of your DAO. With our platform, you can create both utility tokens (for using services) and governance tokens (for voting).

### NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

NFTs are unique digital items that can represent ownership. In this platform, they are used for membership and voting rights.
